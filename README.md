# Pokedex App

This is my first mobile app using Ionic and Angular framework. I started it with a course on Udemy by Maximillian called "Ionic - Build iOS, Android & Web Apps with Ionic & Angular".

I´m planning in adding more features to it, such as adding more pokémon and more info about them in the details page. 

I hope you enjoy it as I enjoyed developing it.
